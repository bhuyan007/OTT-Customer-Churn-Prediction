# OTT-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This is a project I made along with my batchmates for the minor project in KIIT University

## About the Project
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses since it lowers revenue and hinders long-term growth. Because of this, predicting and lowering customer turnover has become a crucial field of machine learning study. Several machine learning algorithms for predicting customer attrition rates are investigated in this research. We examine a real-world dataset from an OTT provider in order to first identify the elements that influence customer attrition. Then, we preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and employ a variety of machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression, decision trees, the LGBM Classifier, support vector machines, random forests, K-nearest neighbor classifiers, XGBoost classifiers, classification using ANN (Artificial Neural Network) models, and various bagging and boosting methods, respectively, in order to create prediction models. Finally, we will produce the prediction results. Our results show that the LGBM Classifier algorithm outperforms other algorithms in predicting customer churn rates, with an accuracy of 90%. We also identify the crucial components, like gender, age, the number of days a subscriber has been active, the number of minutes viewed each week, the number of movies seen, the maximum number of inactive days, etc. Our research highlights the importance of using machine learning techniques to estimate customer churn rates. By doing so, businesses may be better able to identify their most at-risk customers and take preventive measures to maintain them.
